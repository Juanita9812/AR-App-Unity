# AR-App-Unity

In this Augmented Reality App, the user will need the HIRO marker in order to see the 3D objects.
There will be a series of 10 airplane is 10 different scenes and the user will be able to
interact with the models. The user can flip through scenes backwars and forwards.

A cool feature: There will be buttons for certain components of the models to be moved 
to different locations on screen.

p.s: it is still a bit buggy. It's a work in progress.
